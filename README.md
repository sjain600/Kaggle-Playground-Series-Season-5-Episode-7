### **Project Overview**  
This project leverages a dataset capturing key behavioral indicators of **extroversion and introversion**—such as time spent alone, social event attendance, and social media engagement. These traits profoundly influence how individuals interact with their environments, making the dataset invaluable for:  
- **Researchers** in psychology and sociology studying social behavior.  
- **Data scientists** building predictive models for personality classification.  
- **Marketers** analyzing consumer behavior patterns.  

### **Objective**  
The goal is to **predict whether a person is an introvert or extrovert** based on their social behavior and personality traits. To achieve this, I’ve implemented a baseline model with minimal preprocessing and tested three classification algorithms:  
1. **Logistic Regression** (for probabilistic classification).  
2. **Decision Tree Classifier** (for interpretable rules).  
3. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** (for similarity-based prediction).  

### **Why It Matters**  
From clinical psychology to targeted marketing, understanding these traits unlocks insights into human behavior. This project serves as a springboard for applications like:  
- Personality-driven recommendation systems.  
- Social pattern analysis in large populations.  
- Ethical AI development for sensitive trait prediction.
