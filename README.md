The objective of this project is to predict whether a person is an Introvert or an Extrovert, given their social behavior and personality traits. I have added a base model with minimal 
preprocessing and feature engineering. I have used three predictive classification models, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and KNN.
